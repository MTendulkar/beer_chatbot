# TalkBeer Post Cleaner

The second step in my chatbot project is to clean and process my extracted posts. 


## How it Works

This opens the data.csv file generated by the scraper in Step 1. It performs two operations: 

1. It generates a prompt:response dictionary (where a prompt exists). 
2. It generates a .txt file of the post bodies, as a continuous string. 


## Getting Started

Clone the repo to your local machine. 

### Prerequisites 

Move the data.csv file to the current directory, and run the script. Alternatively, modify the file to have an absolute location for the data.csv file.
